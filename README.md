`DATABASE_HOST`
`DATABASE_USERNAME`
`DATABASE_PASSWORD`
`DATABASE_NAME`
`DATABASE_PORT`
`REPO_OWNER`
`REPO_NAME`
`AUTH_TOKEN` (gitHub access token)
`FETCH_DATE_SINCE`(Format: MM-DD-YYYY)



## Getting Started
## Usage
To Run the project, navigate to the projects root directory and do the following:
1. Clone the project from the repository [here](https://github.com/djfemz/savannah_Tech)

2. Before running any commands to build/run the application, make sure that all environment variables in the Environment Variables section [here](#environment-variables) are filled in, especially the `AUTH_TOKEN` (gitHub access token), variable.

3. Ensure that docker is up and running on your computer.
4. If building or running the application the first time, execute the following command:
```shell
docker network create fullstack
```
5. execute the following command to build, test and start the application:
```shell
docker-compose up --build
```

## Testing
- The test suites for all the components of the application are located in the controllers, repositories and services directories in the api directory. The tests are executed as a part of the build process, so running the command below, will execute the tests and the build will fail if any test fails:
```shell
docker-compose up --build
```
